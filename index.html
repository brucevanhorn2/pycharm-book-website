            Wield the PyCharm IDE the way Bruce Lee swings nunchucks!
          </p>
          <br />
          <p class="block">
           High in the sacred Syntax Mountains, up 32,768 stairs lies the Monastery of Code Harmony.
          </p>
          <p class="block">
            For many years, students gathered in the courtyard for their daily coding exercises under the watchful gaze of the Python Sage, Master Py. One afternoon, as the sun cast a warm glow over the bamboo mats, Master Py raised his tail, and the students fell into a respectful silence.
          </p>
          <p class="block">
            "Today," he began, his voice carrying the weight of wisdom, "we shall delve into the realm of debugging, a skill as crucial to a programmer as a warrior's keen senses are on the battlefield."
          </p>
          <p class="block">
            The students listened intently, their minds ready to absorb the sage's teachings. Master Py continued, "To aid us in this endeavor, we shall invoke the aid of a powerful weapon known as PyCharm; a vessel through which we shall channel our intentions into the digital realm."
          </p>
          <p class="block">
            With a flick of his tongue, and a flourish of his tail, Master Py produced a laptop, adorned with a glowing emblem of a snake entwined with lines of code. On the screen, the students could see the PyCharm IDE, a tool that allowed the students to write, test, and debug their Python code with greater efficiency.
          </p>
          <p class="block">
            "Open your minds to the spirit of PyCharm," Master Py instructed, his eyes twinkling with a hint of playfulness. "Just as a warrior and their weapon become one in battle, so too shall you and PyCharm become one in the art of coding."
          </p>
          <p class="block">
            I was there that day.  I remember powering on my laptop, the screen illuminating with the promise of newfound knowledge. With the guidance of Master Py, I navigated the PyCharm IDE, learning to set breakpoints, inspect variables, and trace the flow of their code's execution.  I learned to channel the energy of PyCharm to create many types of Python projects almost instantly, and to shape those projects into ship-able software.  PyCharm became an extension of my mind as I was challenged with web development and data science workflows.  As the sun rose the next day, I found myself exhausted laying on the temple floor, my laptop battery drained.
          </p>
          <p class="block">
            "Remember," Master Py advised, "the spirit of PyCharm is a loyal companion on your coding journey. It aids you in unraveling the mysteries of your code, just as a masterful warrior anticipates their opponent's moves."
          </p>
          <p class="block">
            The next day, I found myself transported back to the mundane realm that occupies most of my days, but I knew that I had to write down all that I had learned lest Master Py's wisdom leave me forever.  This book is the Master's legacy.

            Why should you use <u>this</u> book to learn or teach software
            design patterns in C#?
          </p>
          <p class="title is-4">
            Most books on patterns have one or more problems:
          </p>
          <div class="block">
            <ol>
              <li>
                They are written by university professors for other university
                professors. These people have never had to ship real software on
                a deadline. Learning from them is like learning to play a
                musical instrument from someone who has only ever listened to
                the radio.
                <strong
                  >This book is written in plain English by a real (but not
                  perfect) software developer with over 25 years of experience
                  shipping very large software projects.</strong
                >
              </li>
              <li>
                Writing a book on patterns is hard! Many authors play it safe
                and make every example super-vague, or overly contrived. <em>Class A
                inherits from Class B which depends on Class C.</em> Unless you're
                making a weird alphabet app, that kind of treatment isn't going
                to be very useful. The examples in this book are relatable.
                <strong
                  >If you've ever ridden a bicycle before, you'll understand
                  this book.</strong
                >
              </li>
              <li>
                The implementation language is old, irrelevant, or pseudocode.
                <strong
                  >You need to learn patterns in a language you can actually use. C#
                  is a popular choice.</strong
                >
                The book includes an extensive Appendix to help new developers
                orient to the content in the book.
              </li>
              <li>
                They aren't written with real world business problems in mind.
                The seminal work in software design patterns includes examples
                on UI design in MOTIF, and algorithms for managing lines on
                printed circuit boards.
                <strong
                  >You need a book (like this one) that focuses on the kinds of
                  business scenarios you're actually going to see in your
                  work.</strong
                >
              </li>
              <li>
                They aren't written from a real-world perspective. Does your
                code break? Do you sometimes run with an idea only to find it
                doesn't work out? Have you ever noticed that in most books, that
                never happens?
                <strong
                  >In this book, the characters make mistakes, then learn how to
                  solve them.</strong
                >
              </li>
              <li>
                They go for quantity over quality. Trying to cover every
                software pattern ever conceived is a noble endeavor, but it's
                like trying to document every feature in Excel. Did you know
                Excel can sum a column of numbers? Of course! Did you know there
                is an Excel function to convert your numbers into Roman
                numerals? Some of the patterns outlined in longer books are
                about as useful. You need a book that focuses on the patterns
                you'll really use. <strong>That's what this book does!</strong>

            This book focuses entirely on reality, warts and all. It presents
            the story of two sisters, Kitty and Phoebe, who create a tech
            startup aimed at building the finest bicycles the world has ever
            seen. The girls are not professional software developers, so they
            have to learn as they go.&nbsp; They have business objectives and
            very real competitive pressures just like you do.&nbsp; Left to
            their own devices, their code will turn into a big ball of mud on a
            plate of spaghetti.&nbsp;&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p class="block">
            We start off with some anti-patterns: those practices everybody does
            because either they're lazy, or they cut corners because they're under extreme pressure to
            ship before the code is ready.&nbsp; These conditions can be
            corrected with regular refactoring and code reviews, but they
            usually aren't.&nbsp; The anti-patterns we cover include:

            Meet Kitty and Phoebe – Texas-born sisters who share a love for
            riding bicycles. Phoebe is studying engineering at Southern
            Methodist University, a private university in the sisters’ hometown
            of Dallas, Texas. Kitty is studying industrial design at Sul Ross
            University in the town of Alpine located in west Texas. Purely
            through kismet, they both won a summer internship at MegaBikeCorp, a
            large multi-national bicycle manufacturing company.

          <p class="block">
            After three months of soul crushging big-company bureaucracy, the girls decided
            they could do better. Kitty designs a new line of incredibly
            innovative bicycles. Her sister has the idea to create an automated
            robotic assembly line. The sisters find two abandoned warehouses:
            one in Dallas, the other in the city of Alpine. The two set up shop
            with the help of their father's credit card. (Don't worry, they pay
            him back!)
          </p>
          <p class="block">
            Throughout the story, the sisters are working on building the
            software systems that will control their robotic manufacturing
            facilities. You'll be working alongside them, learning as they do,
            and occasionally making mistakes, and then correcting them.

            The plot of our story takes a dire turn and the heroic sisters must

            In the real world, your business needs to be able to pivot on a dime
            to capture new markets and new opportunities. If your software
            architecture isn't resilient and flexible, you could miss out. The
            only way to have a flexible architecture is to follow SOLID
            principles and utilize patterns.  Stretched thin by their current business committements, the girls have 
            to recruit some help from a skilled developer most companies probably wouldn't hire.  Will this unlikely 
            hero save they day using the patterns learned in the earlier chapters?
